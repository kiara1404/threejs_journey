# Three.js Journey

## Demo

## Description
For this project I challenged myself to learn some of the basics of Three.js for a independent school project. For this project I had to put in at least 28 hours of work. 
I initially planned to follow chapter 1 and 2 of this [course](https://threejs-journey.com/) but I've struggled a lot with the lessons in the first chapter. Some lessons I sometimes was stuck for hours.

This project contains a seperate branch for every lesson I followed.

Eventually I got the basics down and I wanted to combine vanilla JavaScript with Three.js. This was also a headache sometimes.
For this project I wanted the user to be able to change the scene. So the user can make their own 3D scene with two different shapes and put in their own custom text.

It is definitly still a work in progress...

## Dependencies

* Three.js
* gsap
* lil-gui
* vite

## Installation
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:5173
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Reflection
At the beginning I thought that the Three.js library would be difficult.  I followed the course of Bruno Simons, I think the course was really good. He explains everything very well en because it's a video, you can easily pause and come back.
In the introduction video Bruno also says that the course is a lot of new information and that it will be good for you to sometimes stop and comeback. This is good to process all the new material en have a fresh mind the moment you continu. I've done this a lot. This is also one of the reason why I was busy for months for this project.

I was a bit dissapointed in myself that I only finished the first chapter of the course but this already took more time than I planned for chapter 1 & 2. I still had to make my own website, so I decided to incorporate as much as material of the first chapter as I could.
I knew I wanted to make sure that the user have some input to make their own canvas. Again, this was also quite hard but I am pleased that it works. I also wanted to be able to change the colours of the shapes, so I will probably try to add this later on. 

In the end I am happy with the end result. When you look at it at first, it doesn't look like a lot of work but it actually is! I discovered that Three.js has so many possibilies and I still have so much to learn. The combining of regular web design with the canvas of Three.js was also something that was difficult for me. Now everything is in one file so it's a bit chaotic. I tried to make my code modular but for a reason I still don't know, it wasn't working.
I am happy that I've chosen to work with Three.js, there were a lot of challenges but it is a useful skill to have and I am pleased to have learn something new.
