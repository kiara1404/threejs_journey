# Three.js Journey

## Demo

## Description
For this project I challenged myself to learn some of the basics of Three.js for a independent school project. For this project I had to put in at least 28 hours of work. 
I initially planned to follow chapter 1 and 2 of this [course](https://threejs-journey.com/) but I've struggled a lot with the lessons in the first chapter. Some lessons I sometimes was stuck for hours.

This project contains a seperate branch for every lesson I followed.

Eventually I got the basics down and I wanted to combine vanilla JavaScript with Three.js. This was also a headache sometimes.
For this project I wanted the user to be able to change the scene. So the user can make their own 3D scene with two different shapes and put in their own custom text.

It is definitly still a work in progress...
